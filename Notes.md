# Notes
* we have collected data from partiicpants
>>Human participant tests

* We plotted these data from calibration_data folder
* checked everyfile with our eyes and written down a list where should the numpy arrays be cut.
>>add the list here
>>problems we observed and suggestions
>> used .py program for plot file name extraction

* the lists are given to the algorithm for it to copy the files into another folder and cut the rest parts specified by us this creates a new folder with same scturcture as calibration folder but with "segmented" data.
>>the name of the folder:
>>the name of the program.py which has done this task

* these data would be our training data. we might further optimize it by delting the half files but this will be considered another time
## models
* Gesture Model
>>a multiclass model will be trained on all data except for "rest" datas from all participants

* Rest Model
>>a binary model will be trained 
>>>Rest class: "rest" datas from all participants
>>>Non-rest class : all data except for rest data
