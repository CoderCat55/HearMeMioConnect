Processed data yerine yogurt_duzelt_n 'deki rows_delted klasörünü ekledim

example numpy array path : rows_deleted\p1\bek_1765449146.npy
1) gesture model should train on rows_deleted/p{1-6}/all npy arrays that dont start with "rest"
2) Rest model should be like this:
- rest class: rows_deleted/p{1-6}/all npy arrays that start with "rest"
- non-rest class: rows_deleted/p{1-6}/all npy arrays that dont start with "rest"

General calibration'a endpoint eklerken hangi partiicapnt klasörüne kaydedeceiğini specify etmek güzel olur gibi.
Question after I fetch http://bemolhost.local:5002/setcw?name=hello which endpoint should I fetch in order to get the result back like 3 samples has been acquired etc. 

General Calibrate saves to /user folder , it used to be calibration data folder
personal calibrate saves to different folder.
