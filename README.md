Okay as you can see we have a c++ code and a python code
c++ code is just for reference it used to be my old code. Now we are improving it
We got raspberyy pi 5 instead of esp32 and myo armbands (2) instead of other sensors.
We will be running more advanced ML like svm instead of knn.
also we will be recognizing dynamic gestures not just statics so we need some kind of time seriss of data
This is a real time system. 

# Rules
*Please really read all the code. 
*Do not make assumptions while answering. 
*While giving ansswers include the chain of thought, why did you make that assumption, which part of thee code leads you to that? If you are not sure about how something works just tell me.
*Your aim is to discuss the structure with me. I need you to be objective. You should use strategies like listing pros and cons of a situation and judge it according to my aim.
*When change of code only change what is relevant do not try to change anything that is not relevant with my aim. 
*I need to know which parts you have made changes tell me because sometimes you change something inside a fucntion which I am not aware of.
*You may only write which parts of the code I should change and where changes shhould be made to save time instead of writing the whole script again.
*WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM THIS CODE. WHAT CAN IT DO. WHICH MISMATCHES HAVE YOU SPOTTED AS A LIST
