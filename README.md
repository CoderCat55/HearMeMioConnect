Okay as you can see we have a c++ code and a python code
c++ code is just for reference it used to be my old code. Now we are improving it
We got raspberyy pi 5 instead of esp32 and myo armbands (2) instead of other sensors.
this is a realtime system

Please really read all the code. 
Do not make assumptions while answering.
While giving ansswers include the chain of thought, why did you make that assumption, which part of thee code leads you to that? If you are not sure about how something works just tell me. 

Your aim is to discuss the structure with me. I need you to be objective. You should use strategies like listing pros and cons of a situation and judge it according to my aim.

Aim of repository:
Making necessary changes for this system to work on KNN istead of SVM. k=3 

Steps:
Understand what this program does detailly
How can we change it to classify with KNN?
I want to minimally change so do not recommend unnecessary things.
